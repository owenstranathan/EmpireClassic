Things to consider:

    We need two modes:
        Curser
        Movement/Action


    Give pieces IDs in constructor /*

    function to check validity of bounds on move/*

    give constructors to pieces that set position of itself and position of sprite/*

    implement fog of war /*

    implement movement /*
        actual moving of pieces aroound board matrux/*
        event handling/*

    implement cursor interaction/*
        event handling/*
        changing modes/*

    implement textual interface

    once all that is done, implement views
    (which requires understanding of views, which might not be possible at this time)

    menus??

/* means done
